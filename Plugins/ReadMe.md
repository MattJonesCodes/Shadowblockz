# Plugins
This directory contains the source code of plugins which I made for the Shadowblockz Minecraft server. 
The source code was developed in JetBrains IntelliJ, and uses Maven to manage it's dependancies. 

**Note:** If you would like to build these plugins the source code may need to be updated. Due to their age, features of the Bukkit API used may now be deprecated.
