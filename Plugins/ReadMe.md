# Plugins
This directory contains the source code of plugins which I made for the Shadowblockz Minecraft server. 
The source code for the Craftbukkit plugins within this repository were developed in JetBrains IntelliJ, and uses Maven to manage it's dependancies. 
The source code for the Bungeecord plugins were developed in JetBrains IntelliJ.
