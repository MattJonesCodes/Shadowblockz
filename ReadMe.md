# Shadowblockz History

I was the owner & developer of Shadowblockz for six years. Shadowblockz was a Minecraft server which launched on November 26th 2011. It Started out as a small 16 player server, but then quickly expanding into a network of multiple servers, each offering a different unique gameplay experience. Over the course of it's life, it peaked at 250 conturrent players and 120,000+ unique logins.

The network manipulated and added additional features to the base game through the use of Java plugins. This included quests, dungeons with boss fights, skills, achievements and more. Along with the additional functionality added to the game, Java plugins were also created for MiniGames including Egg 'Em All, Capture The Cow and Bunny Tag. This was when I truely started programming, and learnt the fundamentals of the Java programming language.

The network closed in 2018 due to staff having to focus their effors on other things outside of the server, and the loss of server traffic over it's last few months.
